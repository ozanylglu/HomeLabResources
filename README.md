## Automated lab creation tools

GOAD is a pentest active directory LAB project. The purpose of this lab is to give pentesters a vulnerable Active directory environment ready to use to practice usual attack techniques.

[AutomatedLab](https://github.com/AutomatedLab/AutomatedLab)
is a provisioning solution and framework that lets you deploy complex labs on HyperV and Azure with simple PowerShell scripts. It supports all Windows operating systems from 2008 R2 to 2019, some Linux distributions and various products like AD, Exchange, PKI, IIS, etc. 

[Splunk Attack range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range)

[Purple Cloud](https://github.com/iknowjason/PurpleCloud) - An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment of a small Active Directory pentest lab in the cloud. The deployment simulates a semi-realistic corporate enterprise Active Directory with a DC and endpoints. Purple team goals include blue team detection capabilities and R&D for detection engineering new approaches. 

Cyb3rWard0g has [Microsoft-Sentinel2Go](https://github.com/OTRF/Microsoft-Sentinel2Go) which contains scripts in github for multiple configurations to build an entire lab in Azure

[MS Defender Evaluation lab](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/evaluation-lab-expanded-os-support-amp-atomic-red-team/ba-p/2993927) which includes Red Canary's atomic red team.

## How to's and Building Home Lab references

The [UK National Cyber Security Center](https://github.com/ukncsc/lme) has a great project for small/home offices to help them get started with logging.  This can be used for home labs as well. Not a full SIEM solution, but a start.

Offensive Security has a [great blog](https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/tjnulls-guide-to-building-a-home-lab/)  with lots of details and links with a video [here](https://youtu.be/Ed1ujM3xWNg)

From Wazehell, Create a [vulnerable active directory](https://github.com/WazeHell/vulnerable-AD) that's allowing you to test most of active directory attacks in local lab

From [@ajpc500](https://twitter.com/ajpc500), a quick and dirty [PowerShell script](https://gist.github.com/ajpc500/3a86ba1741d4868b69be5ce3a142d527) to install Sysmon (SwiftOnSecurity config), SilkService and Winlogbeat, and forward the logs on to HELK. Might be useful for those looking to quickly configure endpoint logs in a lab environment
